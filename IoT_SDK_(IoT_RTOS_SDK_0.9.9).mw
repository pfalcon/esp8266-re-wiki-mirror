= Obtaining =
To obtain a copy of the 0.9.9 version of the IoT RTOS SDK:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp_iot_rtos_sdk.git
cd esp_iot_rtos_sdk
git checkout ec75c85f9e</pre>

Note that the last (git checkout) line is very important.  To double-check that you are working with the right version, you should run <code>git log</code> and check that the most recent log entry says "update version to 0.9.9, have a try.".  It would also be a good idea to check the LICENSE file and make sure it says "The MIT License (MIT)" at the top.
