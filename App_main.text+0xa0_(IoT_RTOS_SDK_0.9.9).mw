= Called From =

* [[user_start (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|user_start]]

= Description =

This (non-exported) function is used by [[user_start (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|user_start]] to configure the speed parameters needed to talk to the SPI flash chip, based on the speed divisor provided (80 MHz = 1, 40 MHz = 2, etc):

* if ''divisor'' < 2:
*# Set bit 12 (0x1000) of SPI0_CTRL
*# Clear bits 0-11 of SPI0_CTRL
*# Set bit 8 (0x100) of IOMUX_CONF
* else (''divisor'' >= 2):
*# Calculate ''ctrl_bits'' from divisor:
*#* x = ''divisor'' - 1
*#* y = (''divisor'' / 2) - 1
*#* ''ctrl_bits'' = x<<8 + y<<4 + x
*# Clear bit 12 (0x1000) of SPI0_CTRL
*# Clear bit 8 (0x100) of IOMUX_CONF
*# Set bits 0-11 of SPI0_CTRL = ''ctrl_bits''
