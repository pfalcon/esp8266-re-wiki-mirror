<code>void wDev_MacTimArm(uint32 delay)</code>

= Called From =

(Apparently not called by any routines in the SDK)

= Description =

This function sets the first timer built into the wDev/MAC hardware to fire after the specified ''delay'' (measured in ticks).  When it fires, it will trigger an NMI, and bit 27 of [0x3ff20c20] will be set.

# Checks if NMIIrqIsOn (which apparently indicates we're currently inside the NMI service routine), and if not:
## Calls vPortEnterCritical()
## Clears bits 0-4 of [0x3ff00000]
##* Repeats this step until [0x3ff00000] bit 0 reads back cleared
# Reads the 64-bit counter value in [0x3ff21008] (high 32 bits) and [0x3ff21004] (low 32 bits)
# Checks [0x3ff21008] again to make sure it didn't change during the read (indicating the low bits of the counter wrapped around while we were reading), and if so:
#* Reads [0x3ff21004] again too, and uses the updated values
# Adds ''delay'' to the 64-bit counter value
# Writes the new counter value to [0x3ff210a0] (high 32 bits) and [0x3ff2109c] (low 32 bits)
# Sets bit 31 of [0x3ff21098]
# If not NMIIrqIsOn:
## Clears bits 1-4 of [0x3ff00000] and sets bit 0
## Calls vPortExitCritical()
