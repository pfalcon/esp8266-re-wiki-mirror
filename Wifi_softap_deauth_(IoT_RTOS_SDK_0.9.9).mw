Deauths (forcibly removes) a client from the ESP access point by sending a corresponding IEEE802.11 management packet (first) and removing the client from it's data structures (afterwards).
If no no mac is specified, it uses FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. The IEEE802.11 reason code used is 2 for "Previous authentication no longer valid".
