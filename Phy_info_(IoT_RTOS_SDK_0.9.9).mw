=phy_info=

The phy_info data structure is a 128 byte long structure that holds some persistent data about the system - including WiFi, radio configuration, crystal value.

It is stored 0x4000 bytes (16KB) before the end of the flash size (as determined by [[Flashchip_(IoT_RTOS_SDK_0.9.9)|flashchip]] data structure).

=Initial image=

An initial image file "esp_init_data_default.bin" is included with recent Espressif SDKs.

The "[http://www.electrodragon.com/w/Category:ESP8266_Firmware_and_SDK#Updating_Firmware_Flash_Guide Espressif Flash Download Tool]" is able to tweak some of the parameters at flashing time (other parameters are used to seed the 'flashchip' structure linked above.)

If no valid image is found (the first byte at the phy_info offset is not zero) then an initial phy_info structure is loaded from flash as part of the [[App_main.irom0.text%2B0x5b4_(IoT_RTOS_SDK_0.9.9)|app_main initialisation sequence]].

=Fields=

The Arduino team have documented many of the phy_info fields:
