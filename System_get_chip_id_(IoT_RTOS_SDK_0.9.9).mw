<code>uint32 system_get_chip_id(void)</code>

= Called From =

(Not called by any SDK library routines)

= Description =

Returns the unique chip ID burned into the ESP8266 at the factory.

The chip ID is located in the dport0 region in bytes 0x3ff00053..0x3ff00056.  Note, however, that these memory locations must be accessed with 32-bit aligned reads, so some additional logic is required to shift the bits around before returning them.

# Returns ([0x3ff00050] >> 24) | ([0x3ff00054] << 8)

= Chip ID =

* Bottom 24 bits of the chip ID are used for default MAC address.

* Top 8 bits appear to be zero on some (all?) chips (sampled chips with MAC address OUIs 5c:cf:7f, 18:fe:34)

= See Also =

* [[app_main.text+0x14 (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|app_main.text+0x14]] -- Called on boot to use the low 24 bits of the chip ID to produce the default MAC address.
