'''Note:''' The reset vector is 0x40000080, which is (predictably) located within the [[#Boot ROM|Boot ROM]] region.

== <span id="unk_0">Unknown Region 0 (0x00000000 - 0x1FFFFFFF)</span> ==

Causes fault when reading.  Portions of the SDK apparently do byte-writes to addresses 0x00000000 and 0x00000001, however.  May be a write-only MMIO region of some kind.

== <span id="dport0">Dport0 Region (0x3FF00000 - 0x3FF0FFFF)</span> ==

Memory-mapped I/O, apparently for functions related to the core Xtensa architecture (as opposed to peripherals). (Reportedly repeats every 0x100 bytes)

This is referred to as "DPORT0" in the Espressif header files and linker scripts, but very little additional information about it is provided.

== <span id="wdev">Wdev Control Registers (0x3FF20000 - 0x3FF2FFFF)</span> ==

This region appears to contain memory-mapped IO registers for interacting with the WiFi MAC module and related functions (which appear to be collectively referred to as "wdev" in the SDK)

See also: [[Memory_Regions_(IoT_RTOS_SDK_0.9.9)#wdev]]

== <span id="unk_1">Unknown Region 1 (0x3FFC0000 - 0x3FFDFFFF)</span> ==

Reading from this region apparently just returns the memory address.  It's unclear whether this is for some purpose or not.

{{Todo|Determine access/alignment requirements}}

== <span id="dram">Data RAM (0x3FFE8000 - 0x3FFFFFFF)</span> ==

This is standard RAM intended for storing application/system data.  Supports sub-word (byte, half-word) accesses.  Contents are lost on power-off or deep-sleep mode.

When using the SDK, this region is further divided up as follows:

* 0x3FFE8000 - 0x3FFFBFFF -- User data RAM (available to the application)
* 0x3FFFC000 - 0x3FFFFFFF -- Reserved for the ETS/SDK system

(Note that even when not using the SDK, some library routines in the boot ROM area may still assume this layout and attempt to use arbitrary memory in the 0x3FFFC000 portion if they are called (whether this is actually true is currently unclear))

== <span id="brom">Boot ROM (0x40000000 - 0x4000FFFF)</span> ==

Read-only memory containing instruction code programmed into the chip by Espressif which (as far as is known) cannot be reprogrammed.  This ROM contains both the initial boot code and first-stage boot loader, as well as a number of library routines which can be called from the application or SDK to perform basic functions.

=== Exception Vectors ===

The Xtensa exception vector base address defaults to 0x40000000 (the beginning of the boot ROM). ESP IoT SDK pre-1.1.0 use this as-is, but the RTOS SDK and recent ESP IoT SDK move it to IRAM during initialisation using the WSR.VECBASE instruction (actual addresses can be seen in linker script).  Default addresses are as follows:

| 0x40000050 || UserException
|-
| 0x40000070 || DoubleException
|-

|}

== <span id="iram">Instruction RAM (0x40100000 - 0x40107FFF)</span> ==

General-purpose instruction RAM.  Contents are lost on power-off or deep-sleep mode.

Code is loaded into this region by the boot loader from the SPI Flash prior to starting the user portion of the application.

== <span id="map_iram">Mappable Instruction RAM (0x40108000 - 0x4010FFFF)</span> ==

Instruction RAM/FLASH cache ram. OTA bootloader uses it.  Apparently mapped as two separate 16 KB blocks (0x4000):

* 0x40108000 - 0x4010BFFF: Mapped if bit 4 (bit mask 0x10) is clear in the dport0 register 0x3ff00024
* 0x4010C000 - 0x4010FFFF: Mapped if bit 3 (bit mask 0x8) is clear in the dport0 register 0x3ff00024

{{question|How is this related to the SPI Flash cache?  Why is it possible to unmap it?}}
{{hypothesis|This may be the same physical RAM as is used for the SPI Flash cache, and these bits just switch it between being used for cache vs. for general-purpose IRAM.  If so, this implies it may be possible to pick between using 16 KB vs 32 KB cache size (and use the rest for IRAM)}}
{{question|Assuming the above, does this have anything to do with the mysterious third parameter to [[Cache_Read_Enable]]?}}

== <span id="unk_2">Unknown Region 2 (0x40110000 - 0x40140000)</span> ==

Zeroes, possibly more IRAM.

{{todo|Determine whether this is in fact RAM, access/alignment requirements, etc}}

== <span id="flashcache">SPI Flash Cache (0x40200000 - 0x40300000)</span> ==

A selectable portion of the external SPI Flash memory can be mapped to this address range (for example, to execute code directly from Flash).  The memory-mapping includes a cache to speed up frequently-accessed portions (the size and configuration of the cache layer is currently unclear).

For more information on how this is configured, see [[SPI_Flash_Mapping]]

== <span id="mmio">Memory-Mapped IO Ports (0x60000000 - 0x6FFFFFFF)</span> ==

This region contains the interface ports for most of the peripheral devices inside the ESP8266.  Except for the PHY hardware interface at 0x60009824, the ports for each device appear to be mapped in distinct 0x100-byte address blocks, making them easy to identify and distinguish:

{{inprogress|Will be fleshing this section out with info on individual ports (based on info from [[Memory_Regions_(IoT_RTOS_SDK_0.9.9)]]) soon|[[User:Foogod|Foogod]] ([[User talk:Foogod|talk]]) 01:54, 27 July 2015 (EDT)}}

It is unclear whether anything is mapped in this region beyond 0x60009d74.  Nothing in the SDK appears to reference it (but then the I2S and DMA regions were also previously unreferenced/unknown until the MP3 example code was released, so it's possible there's more here we just don't know about).  Further testing may be required.
