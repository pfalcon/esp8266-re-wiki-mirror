This page is intended to describe ESP8266-specific terms. More general and widely known terms should be looked up in a search engine on Wikipedia.

=== BootROM ===

ESP8266 has non-modifiable (apparently, mask-technology) ROM, containing 1) bootloader; 2) function library. It is collectively called "BootROM". Avoid calling it just "ROM", that's too unspecific and confusing.

=== CHM ===

There're handful of APIs named chm_*. CHM is Channel Manager.

=== DRAM ===

In ESP8266 (maybe Xtensa) parlance, DRAM is "Data RAM". But such abbreviation conflicts with generally used DRAM term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM , so avoid its usage and just say "data RAM".

=== ESF ===

There're handful of APIs named esf_*.

=== ETS ===

ETS appears to be a name/abbreviation of simple RTOS included in BootROM. There're number of APIs named ets_*.

=== IC ===

"ic" is network interface structure (commonly used abbreviation in other projects is "if").

=== IRAM ===

Instruction RAM.

=== LMAC ===

LMAC is surely some kind of MAC (low MAC? link MAC?). There're number of APIs named lmac_*.

=== PHY ===

Physical layer of WiFi implementation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHY_(chip)

=== PP ===

Facts:
* There's libpp.a
* There're number of APIs named pp_*, and these are APIs which appear to deal with packet processing tasks.
* It's not clear if PP is only software component, or backed by some hardware too, but the latter is possible, at least there's separate "PP version": [[User_init_task_(IoT_RTOS_SDK_0.9.9)]]

PP may mean Packet Processor.
