=wDev_ProcessFiq=

wDev_ProcessFiq is defined in wdev.o inside libpp.a. It is the interrupt handler for the NMI (see also [[Watchdog Timer]]).

(FIQ = fast interrupt request, for the highest priority interrupt in the system.)

==NMI Exception Vector==

Incoming call trace goes something like

* _NMIExceptionVector jumps to unnamed routine 0x001010c in xtensa_vectors.o
* Routine saves register state ,calls wDev_ProcessFiq
* After execution, restore register state, etc.

==Behaviour==

* Waits for bit 0 in 0x3ff00000 to clear. (Behaviour seems odd - it writes to that address clearing all bits but 0x60, then reads back immediately to check bit 0 and repeats if it is set.)
* Reads 0x3ff20c20 and checks for zero
* Reads status bits from 0x3ff20c24 (are these irq flags?) and calls various routines (mostly static).
** Panics if bit 28 is set
** Bit 26 indicates [[Watchdog Timer]]/[[WDev MacTim1Arm (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|WDev MacTim1Arm]] and calls stored timer routine via memory pointer (addr?) which checks if watchdog has been fed since last timeout.
** Bit 27 is set by [[WDev_MacTimArm (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|WDev_MacTimArm]] and also goes via memory pointer, address doesn't seem used?
** Then checks bits 3,4,32,possibly others?

At various points the routine may panic, print "wdev.c -line number-" and abort in an infinite loop.

At various places handler calls out into:
* lmacProcessRtsStart
* lmacProcessTXStartData
* lmacProcessCollisions
* lmacIsActive
* lldesc_num2link
* lmacProcessAckTimeout
* lmacProcessTxSuccess
* lmacProcessTxRtsError
* lmacProcessCtsTimeout
* lmacProcessTxError

==Guess at what's happening==

Seems to be multi-purpose:

* MacTim1/MacTim2 seem to be general purpose timers.
* lMAC-related functions all seem to be transmit. Also timeouts for collision timer, etc? Or maybe NMI is triggered when a transmit DMA buffer empties?
