=wDev_ProcessFiq=

wDev_ProcessFiq is defined in wdev.o inside libpp.a. It is the interrupt handler for the NMI (see also [[Watchdog Timer]]).

(FIQ = fast interrupt request, for the highest priority interrupt in the system.)

==NMI Exception Vector==

Incoming call trace goes something like

* _NMIExceptionVector jumps to unnamed routine 0x001010c in xtensa_vectors.o
* Routine saves register state ,calls wDev_ProcessFiq
* After execution, restore register state, etc.

==Behaviour==

* Waits for bit 0 in 0x3ff00000 to clear. (Behaviour seems odd - it writes to that address clearing all bits but 0x60, then reads back immediately to check bit 0 and repeats if it is set.)
* Reads 0x3ff20c20 and checks for zero
* Reads status bits from 0x3ff20c24 (are these irq flags?) and calls various routines (mostly static).
** Panics if bit 28 is set
** Bit 26 indicates [[Watchdog Timer]]/[[WDev MacTim1Arm (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|WDev MacTim1Arm]] and calls stored timer routine via memory pointer (addr?) which checks if watchdog has been fed since last timeout.
** Bit 27 is set by [[WDev_MacTimArm (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|WDev_MacTimArm]] and also goes via memory pointer, address doesn't seem used?
** Then checks bits 3,4,32,possibly others?

At various points the routine may panic, print "wdev.c -line number-" and abort in an infinite loop.

At various places handler calls out into:
* lmacProcessRtsStart
* lmacProcessTXStartData
* lmacProcessCollisions
* lmacIsActive
* lldesc_num2link
* lmacProcessAckTimeout
* lmacProcessTxSuccess
* lmacProcessTxRtsError
* lmacProcessCtsTimeout
* lmacProcessTxError

==Guess at what's happening==

[[Watchdog Timer]] describes this handler as on a timer, so I think this could be that the timeout handler from [[wDev_MacTim1Arm]] triggers retransmission after a collision or following an RTS request??

It's possible that all transmissions get pushed into this code path via the NMI, or that the NMI is also triggered by the WiFi hardware DMA engine after a transmission?
