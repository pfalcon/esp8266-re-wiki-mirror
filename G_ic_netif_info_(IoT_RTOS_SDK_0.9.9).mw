This structure apparently contains information which depends on whether the system is operating in station mode or softap mode (two different copies of this structure are maintained and pointed to by [[g_ic (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|g_ic]].station_netif_info and [[g_ic (IoT RTOS SDK 0.9.9)|g_ic]].softap_station_info)
